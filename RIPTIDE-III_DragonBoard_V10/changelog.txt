Revision 1:
Created new Quartus project (version 10.0)
Modified data interface.
Removed unused registers.
Found possible bug in 8X-300 and 8X-RIPTIDE.
	IO_n_LB_r is driven by n_LB_r6. It should be driven by n_LB_r.
Integrated IO_latch into shift_merge.
Implemented p_cache_miss input.
Implemented d_cache_miss input.
Created validation platform with serial module.
Wrote test program for CPU.
	All tests passed.
Created testbench for simulation.
Created data cache.
Created program cache.
Created testbench for simulating caches.
Modified assembler program to generate MIF files directly.
Switched to using 16-bit program ROM initialized from MIF file.
Created SRAM controller for testing caches.
Added initialization port to SRAM controller.

Revision 2:
updated Quartus version to 13.0
Created cache memory model for simulation.
Fixed bugs in both cache controllers.
Fixed bug in SRAM controller.
All cache test ran successfully.

Revision 3:
Fixed the d_cache_miss input.
Connected cache controllers to CPU on top level.
Updated whole system testbench.
Fixed bug in PC module (address undefined at startup).
Fixed bug in decode unit (rotate source and rotate mux undefined at startup).
Fixed possible bug in decode unit (latch_wren_reg undefined after reset).

NOTE: fmax is limited by paths from cache memories to PC and data address output. It is not possible to add interrupts without further lowering the fmax or making major changes to the memory sytem and PC module.
	Interrupts will not be implemented in the RIPTIDE-II processor.

The FPGA board I was using for this project has multiple pins that are not working, at least one is needed for this design.
The project will be moved to a new board. Due to the SRAM requirements I may need to design a custom board.

Revision 4:
Created new project in Vivado 2019.1.
Created top_level_wrapper with PLL and button mapping.
Created SRAM_controller_internal module.
	This is a memory controller designed to drive block RAM in Xilinx FPGAs.
Created SRAM_internal. This is a 64KB BRAM.
Created a new PRG_ROM module.
Modified assembler to create COE files for Vivado.
Created new p_mem module.
Fixed bug in PC module. The p_cache_miss input is now edge triggered.
Fixed bug in PC module. The PC_I_field register chain was moved to the RIPTIDE_II module and is now controlled by the data_hazard signal.
Fixed bug in hazard unit: IO_hazard_write_miss should depend on WC_reg6, not WC_reg7.
Removed unnecessary logic from RIPTIDE_II module.

Revision 5:
Copied changes from RIPTIDE-II Rev 5 project.
	Modified d_cache mem_req logic in preparation for implementing cache flush.
		Main memory requests are delayed by one cycle (only during flush and reset) so that valid tag data can be read before the request.
	Implemented flush input in d_cache.
	Created MSC module and file.
	Instantiated MSC in top_level.
	Added logic in d_cache to ignore the CPU address when it is not valid.
	Modified the serial module to prevent false triggering by adding a read enable input.
	Modified the d_cache module so that cache flush does not reset the cache. If a reset is desired it can be triggered manually through the MSC.
Fixed bug in d_cache that caused the cached controller to crash in some cases when reading and writing simultaneously.
The following code can be used to trigger the bug:

LONG_JUMP
	XMIT $FF, IVL
	XMIT $FC, IVR
	XMIT $0B, LIV3, 4
	XMIT $0F, LIV7, 4	;SET LEDs

	XMIT $FF, IVL
	XMIT $FF, IVR
	XMIT $0A, RIV3, 4
	XMIT $0F, RIV7, 4
	XMIT $FE, IVR
	XMIT $00, RIV7, 8	;CREATE RET INSTRUCTION AT ADDRESS $7FFF IN PROGRAM SPACE ($FFFF AND FFFE IN DATA SPACE)
	XMIT $0F, IVL
	MOVE RIV7, 8, AUX	;CAUSE CACHE MISS TO MOVE NOP TO MAIN MEMORY
	XMIT $7F, AUX		;SET PAGE REGISTER TO $7F
	CALL $FF	;CALL ADDRESS $7FFF
	
	XMIT $FF, IVL
	XMIT $FC, IVR
	XMIT $0D, LIV3, 4
	XMIT $0F, LIV7, 4	;TURN ON LEDs
	JMP XEC_IV_TEST

Found bug: No hazard detection for OVF register. OVF is written in stage 3, but read in stage 1.
A forwarding path through the ALU and mask unit can eliminate the need for some of this hazard detection.
These forwarding paths could be used for all registers to achieve a significant performance gain.

Added hazard detection for OVF reads.

Revision 6:
Added MC6847_gen3 display controller to project.
Changed address width of MC6847 to 12 bits.
Created CHR_ROM and memory config file.
Created VGA_RAM.
Created VGA module.
Modified PLL settings to get a 25MHz clock instead of 24MHz.
Instantiated VGA module in top_level.
Removed serial CPU module.
Removed unused files from project.

TODO:
	Implement SDRAM controller. (Will do on a different board because this one has DDR SDRAM)
	Look into using forwarding paths for register file and OVF (Will need to duplicate some logic).
	Implement HDMI video output.

Revision 7:
Created new Quartus 18.1 project.
Copied files from Rev 6. BRAM modules will have to be replaced.
Created SDRAM_DP64_I SDRAM controller module. The interface is slightly different than the SRAM controller.
Created new p_mem module.
Created new PRG_ROM module.
Added bits to page registers in MSC module.
Copied 3-bit MC6847_gen3 module.
Created new CHR_ROM module.
Created PLL module and new clocks.
Changed mem_req logic in p_cache.
Modified UART for 50MHz.
NOTE: p_mem must be configured to output new data when reading during write. If old data is output the cache controllers will not work.
Fixed bug in d_cache (flush was not working).
Added hex display outputs.
All tests ran successfully in hardware, but simulation fails because SDRAM model contains xx at startup.

Revision 8:
Added logic to MSC so that it does not reset or flush the caches while a memory operation is in progress.
Fixed bug in decoder module (incorrect logic for latch_wren_reg).
Fixed bug in data cache (writes during memory fetch are not processed and must result in a miss).
Performance fix in RIPTIDE_II (data reads dissabled during IO hazards to prevent false triggering of cache misses and IO module functions).
Added ps2_host module.
Created keyboard module.
Updated top level to include new modules.
Configured ROM with keyboard test program.
Fixed bug in UART module (rx_ready held high for 2 cycles).
Modified serial module to include 8 byte RX and TX buffers.
Modified keyboard module to include 8 byte RX and TX buffers.
Fixed bug in ps2_host module (rx_ready held high for 2 cycles).

Revision 9:
Created timer module.
Updated top level to include timer module.
Rewrote IO multiplexer section.
Cleaned up top level.
Found bug in PC? (RET instruction returns to the wrong address (one higher than expected)).
	Simulation shows that the wrong address is pushed onto the call stack.
	Fixed bug in PC (address pipeline must stall on data_hazard).
Fixed bug in timer port connections on top level.
Found bug in decoder (incorrect RC output for instruction 78 20	XOR	RIV0 1 R0).
	Simulation shows that rotate_mux_reg is generated incorrectly (the correct value is 0).
	The rotate_mux signal should not matter when the data source is the IV bus, but it is used to generate the RC signal.
	Added separate logic for RC signal and left rotate_mux unchanged.
	Modified hazard unit to use the RC signal instead of inferring it from rotate_source and rotate_mux.
Fixed performance issue in decoder (XMIT and JMP set rotate_source to avoid regf hazards).
Fixed bug in MC6847_gen3 (vertical counters increment at start of horizontal blank and not when col_count overflows).

Revision 10:
Created new RIPTIDE-III project (Quartus 18.1).
Created new memory IP files.
Changed register file architecture and destination/source address paths.
	New register file includes IVR and IVL registers, as well as new general purpose registers introduced with the N8X305 processor.
	TODO:
		(done) Change decoder to output destination/source addresses in the new format.
		(done) Change rotate_mux logic in decoder to support the new general purpose registers.
		(done) Update NOP detection logic in decoder.
		(done) Change hazard unit to support new address format.
		(done) Remove IVR and IVL from merge unit.
		(done) Update decoder to exclude IVL and IVR from latch write enable signal generation.
		(done) Update decoder to include IVL and IVR in regf_wren signal generation.
		(done) Reduce the latch address signals down to a single bit.
		(done) Update hazard unit to support the new timing of IVL and IVR (moved from stage 6 to stage 5).
Increased call stack size to 16 levels.
Found possible bug: latch_address_r_reg is driven by I_reg[4:3]. It should be I_reg[12:11]?
	Not a bug, but latch address_r_reg is always the same as latch_address_w_reg and is therefore not needed.
	Removed latch_addres_r and latch_address_r_reg from decoder.
	Removed latch_address_r and related signals from RIPTIDE-III module.
Found performance issue: Hazard unit seems to have unnecessary regf_hazard (regf_hazard5).
	Removed regf_hazard5 and related signals.
Found performance issue: Hazard unit has unnecessary IO_hazard (IO_hazard7).
	Removed IO_hazard7 and related signals.
Set correct input/output delays in SDC file.
Set false paths in SDC fille.
Cleaned up RIPTIDE-III module.
Cleaned up right_rotate module.
Cleaned up reg_file module.
Cleaned up shift_merge module.
Cleaned up decode_unit.

TODO:
	(done) Because changing the IV bus address is now done earlier than writing IV bus data, the hazard unit must ensure that any IV bus writes complete before the address is changed.
	(done) Add forwarding path for AUX.
	(done) Update hazard unit to consider AUX forwarding path.
	(done) Add forwarding paths through register file.
	(done) Update hazard unit to consider register forwarding paths.
	(done) Have separate data path for register data that bypasses the mask unit.
	(done) Update hazard unit to consider new data paths.
	Have separate OVF path that bypasses right rotate and mask units.
	(done) Change right rotate and shift units to use modern bit naming (bit 7 is MSB, bit 0 is LSB).
	Write new PC module with support for interrupts.

Revision 11:
Performance tradeoff:
	In order to resolve conditional branches at stage 3 (as opposed to stage 5), the ability to use LIV and RIV as source registers for NZT and XEC will be removed.
	The loss of this feature is deemed acceptable because of the significant performance boost that can be gained by removing it, and because when used, it causes conditional
	branch instructions to have a much smaller range (32 as opposed to 256).
	Removing this feature greatly simplifies the PC module, and may result in a higher Fmax for the design (some of the most critical paths are in the PC).
Changed decoder to select AUX register for CALL instructions.
Created interrupt_controllser module.
Added interrupt outputs to serial module.
Added interrupt outputs to keyboard module.
Added interrupt outputs to timer module.
Instantiated interrupt_controller on top level.
Made IVL and IVR registers readable.

TODO:
	(done) Write new PC module with support for interrupts.
	(done) Change pipeline to support new PC module.
	(done) Change hazard unit to support new PC module.
	(done) Make sure that data in address pipeline is valid during interrupts.
	(done) Make sure that XEC instructions do not return before target instruction is fetched successfully.
	Have separate OVF path that bypasses right rotate and mask units.

Revision 12:
Created new project (Quartus 19.1)
Removed hex display module.
Created new PLL module.
Created new BRAM modules.
Copied top level reset logic from NeonFox project.
Created memory_arbiter module.
Completed SDRAM8_SP8_B8_I module.
Updated SDRAM memory model to support the TMS626812A-10 chip.
Encountered bugs, simulation does not show the problem.
	The chosen test program (riptide3_snake) does not write to memory within the time that can be simulated.
	The memory arbiter and controller will need to fully validated separately.
	Validated memory controller and arbiter with NeonFox programmer tool.
Fixed bug in RIPTIDE-III CPU core (Address pipe in PC module not updated after JMP instruction).
	This bug was very hard to find (300 ms simulation needed).
	The prev_pipeline_flush signal in the PC module was replaced with the new signal prev_branch_taken.
	The pipeline flush and decoder reset logic was moved from the hazard module to the PC module.
Fixed bug in ps2_host module (tx_shift_reg needs to be set during reset).
Made changes to interrupt controller:
	Interrupt 0 no longer acts as a global interrupt enable.
	Added timmer to delay interrupts if they happen too soon after the status register is written.
